# What is java?

- Java is a high-level and object-oriented programming language.
- It is used to develop different types of applications.
- Java is platform independent, which means a program written in Java can run on any operating system.
  This is possible because Java uses bytecode and JVM.

- Java follows the principle Write Once, Run Anywhere.
- It is secure, reliable, and easy to use.

- Java is widely used in web applications, mobile apps, and banking systems.

Before Java, programs written in languages like C and C++ were machine dependent.
This means if a program was written and compiled on Windows, it would not run on Linux or Mac.
Developers had to rewrite the same program for different operating systems, which increased time, cost, and errors.
Java solved this problem by introducing the concept of Bytecode and JVM.
When we write a Java program, it is not directly converted into machine code.
Instead, it is compiled into an intermediate code called bytecode.

This bytecode is platform independent and can run on any operating system.
Each operating system has its own Java Virtual Machine, and the JVM converts the bytecode into machine code at runtime.

Because of this, the same Java program can run on any system without modification, which is called
“Write Once, Run Anywhere.”

So, Java mainly solved the platform dependency problem, and also improved security, memory management, and portability.
