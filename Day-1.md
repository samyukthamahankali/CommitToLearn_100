# What is Java?

- Java is a high-level and object-oriented programming language.
- It is used to develop different types of applications.
- Java is platform independent, which means a program written in Java can run on any operating system.
  This is possible because Java uses bytecode and JVM.

- Java follows the principle Write Once, Run Anywhere.
- It is secure, reliable, and easy to use.

- Java is widely used in web applications, mobile apps, and banking systems.

# Why was Java created?

- Java was created to solve the problem of platform dependency.
  Before Java, programs worked only on one operating system.

- Java was designed so that the same program can run on different systems without changing the code.
  This was achieved using bytecode and the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).

- Java was also created to be secure, reliable, and easy to use, especially for internet and network-based applications.

# What is the biggest problem Java solved?

- Before Java, programs written in languages like C and C++ were machine-dependent.
- This means if a program was written and compiled on Windows, it would not run on Linux or Mac.
- Developers had to rewrite the same program for different operating systems, which increased time, cost, and errors.
- Java solved this problem by introducing the concept of Bytecode and the JVM.
- When we write a Java program, it is not directly converted into machine code.
Instead, it is compiled into an intermediate code called bytecode.

- This bytecode is platform-independent and can run on any operating system.
Each operating system has its own Java Virtual Machine, and the JVM converts the bytecode into machine code at runtime.

- Because of this, the same Java program can run on any system without modification, which is called
      # Write Once, Run Anywhere.

- So, Java mainly solved the platform dependency problem and also improved security, memory management, and portability.
